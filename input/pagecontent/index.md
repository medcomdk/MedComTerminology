# Introduction - work in progress

This implementation guide (IG) is provided by MedCom to describe the use of FHIR ®© Terminology in exchange of information within the Danish healthcare sector.

The MedCom Terminology IG offers stakeholders of the possibility to view terminologies online and to download them in different formats. 

The IG contains CodeSystems, ValueSets, and ConceptMaps developed by MedCom and used in MedCom standards and IGs, such as [MedComCore IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-core/) or [MedComCareCommunication IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-carecommunication/). CodeSystems, ValueSets, and ConceptMaps are provided together with their associated historical versions. 

Previously, have CodeSystems, ValueSets, and ConceptMaps been included in the respective IG. When storing them on a separate server, it allows to update a terminology and maintain the historical versions at the same time.
